/**
 * <b>XML Serialization</b>
 *
 * <p>Description: </p>
 * Allows object xml serialization. To make an object implementing this
 * interface persistent, it is enough to simply call <code>writeXML()</code> with
 * a valid <code>XMLStreamWriter</code>. To load an object again it suffices to
 * create an empty object of this type and call <code>readXML()</code>.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is recommended to set protected access to the empty object constructor and
 * provide a static <code>read()</code> method, such that one can only construct
 * vaild objects.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Please note</b>, that there is no mechanism to detect cycles during the
 * serialization process. Due to the recursive design of this interface deep
 * object structures might raise a <code>java.lang.StackOverflowError</code>.
